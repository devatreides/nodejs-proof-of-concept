# NodeJS: 1ยบ Proof of Concept

A short NodeJS application for testing some development concepts such as http requests using express and the use of middlewares for entry validation

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. For being a proof of concept, there's no deployment state for this project. You can also run this project with **Gitpod**, just clicking on the button on top of this repository. To know more about **Gitpod**, just click [here](https://www.gitpod.io/).

### Prerequisites

You just need to have a **Node** version installed on your machine. In the case you don't have one, follow these [instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

This application don't have a graphic interface, so you will need a tool for making the requests. There's many tools on the Internet, but I like these one: **Insomnia** and you can learn how to install it [here](https://insomnia.rest/download/) 

### Installing

With **Node** installed on your machine, clone this repository and then run this command on terminal inside the root project:

```shell
yarn install & yarn dev
```

If you don't see any errors in the execution of the command above, open a browser and type this url: `http://localhost:3000/projects`. You should see something like this:
